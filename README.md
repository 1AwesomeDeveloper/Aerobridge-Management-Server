## About 

This is a open source implementation of the "Manufacturer's Management Server" to help with key signing and managing interactions with India's [Digital Sky](https://digitalsky.dgca.gov.in/) API infrastructure. This server can be deployed to any public and private cloud and be used to manage communication with DGCA's NPNT and Digital Sky Infrastructure.

As of November 2020, once you connect / point your GCS software to an instance and can do the following using Aerobridge API:

- Flight log management: Upload Bundled Logs to the DGCA API and store logs on the server
- Permission Artefact management: Submission of flight plans and fetching permission artefacts

## Test drive
